## A notification service to send me notifications when winds are good for kiteboarding

Homepage showing current winds for kite-boarding spots in Auckland and a notification service to provide notifications when the winds are good.

## Code Examples

Code examples will be coming

## Motivation

I keep missing opportunities to get out kiteboarding because I forget to check the wind readings. I want to build a notification service over the top of the [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) API so I get notifications when the winds are strong enough and from a good direction.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd` into the directory
3. Type `npm i`
4. `npm start` will start `webpack-dev-server`
5. Page will be up at localhost:8080

## Tests
